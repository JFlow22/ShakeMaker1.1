A ASP.NET site using MVC architecture.

The site is a database for different kinds of cocktails. Any cocktail page includes the name of the cocktail, the ingredients,
the way of making and if exist, a video that shows how to make the cocktail. Cocktails can be added by the admins and regular users
that signed the website has a "Favorite Cocktails" list which he can add his favorite cocktails to it.

We wrote this is in C# and used Microsoft Azure as our database contributor.
For saving our data, we used  Microsoft Framework Entity Code First.
For some of our asynchronous actions, we used jQuery.
For a little bit of design we used Bootstrap 4.

Hope you will enjoy your visit.
